## Project Description:
The goal of the project in the broadest sense is to infer if there are any factors that dominate why a certain individual is photographed more/less than others. For the purpose of our experiments we considered the giraffes and zebra from Great Zebra Count rally which was a citizen science event that happened in Nairobi National Park. Photographers roamed around clicking pictures of animals they saw and now we are computing all statistics from the GZC rally data that will give us an idea to see if there was any ecological or biological feature of an animal that dominated the reason of why a certain picture was taken.

For the purpose of our experiments, we calculate the number of times a certain individual was photographed, number of times certain individual was photographed per photographers. We then considered biological features like age, sex and other features like view_point, yaw, quality of the animal in the photograph and built plots to see if a certain feature contributed more towards that kind of photo being taken for a given contributor. The future of this project will be to quantify any existing bias of human photographers towards clicking pictures of animals. This in turn will help in population estimation of certain animals using pictures from IBEIS or even from Social Media.
